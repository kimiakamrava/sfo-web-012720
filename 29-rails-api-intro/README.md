# Rails as an API üõ∞

## Goals üç≤

- [ ] Define the utility of JSON üß±
- [ ] Review the HTTP request/response cycle and REST ‚ôªÔ∏è
- [ ] Configure a Rails application to behave as a RESTful API üõ∞
- [ ] Access a Rails API via JavaScript üì°
- [ ] Survey the purpose of CORS ü§ù
- [ ] Build out a simple fullstack app with a vanilla triple-threat frontend and a RESTful Rails API backend üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## JavaScript Object Notation üß±

- Text-based format representing structured data in JavaScript object syntax
- JSON exists as a string a "stringified object"
- Can be used independent of JavaScript; it's _language agnostic_
- Looks like a Ruby hash
- To turn objects/hashes into JSON strings:
  - In JavaScript we can use `JSON.stringify()` and pass in a JS object
  - In Rails we can call the `to_json` method (provided by Rails) on any ruby hash
- To turn JSON strings back into objects/hashes:
  - In both Ruby and JavaScript we can use `JSON.parse()` and pass in a object/hash

## The HTTP Request-Response Lifecycle and REST ‚ôªÔ∏è

> ü§î What is the HTTP Request-Response Lifecycle again?
> ü§ì A client sends a request, and a server replies with a response. The request consists of information such as the HTTP version, request method, resource path, header with metadata, and optional body of data. The server sends a response consisting of information including the status code, header with metadata, and an optional body of data.

> ü§î What is a RESTful API?
> ü§ì A REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface is a program interface that maps HTTP requests to database CRUD actions. For example, GET /users should Read all User instances in a database, and PATCH /posts/2 should Update the Post instance with an id of 2.

## Making an API out of Rails üõ∞

- Remember `render`? Try: `render json: @animals`
- Additionally, response can be respons*ive*

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { render :index }
      format.json { render json: @users }
    end
  end
end
```

- `rails new YOUR_APP_NAME --api`
  - Configures application with less middleware (e.g.: no cookie support)
  - `ApplicationController` inherits from `ActionController::API` instead of `ActionController::Base` (no browser functionalities)
  - Generators won't generate views, helpers, or assets with resources
- **Recommended:** Version your endpoints (e.g. `rails g controller api/v1/users`)
  - If API response changes, you should signal your users!
  - Make sure you sync your routes with your controller

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :users, only: [:index]
    end
  end
end
```

- To specify "shape" of data, use `only:`, `include:` options with `render json:`

```ruby
# UsersController
def index
    @users = User.all
    render json: @users, only: [:id, :name], include: :tweets
end

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "coffee_dad",
  "tweets": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "content": "good # coffee",
      "user_name": "coffee_dad"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "content": "having # coffee",
      "user_name": "coffee_dad"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "content": "they will pay for what they've done",
      "user_name": "coffee_dad"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ü§ù

> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.

[MDN on CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

> A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.

- CORS is a security feature, like an apartment complex doorman
- Two separate websites (origins) should not freely communicate with each other
  - Requests can be forged through planted scripts
  - Formal headers (i.e. identification) should be presented
- Servers must specify who and how resources can be accessed

## Accessing Rails API with JavaScript üì°

- While in development...
  - Uncomment the rack-cors gem from your gemfile. `bundle install`
  - Open APPLICATION_NAME/config/initializers/cors.rb and change the settings to the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins '*'

    resource '*',
      headers: :any,
      methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head]
  end
end
```

- **Change in production**


## Bringing it all home üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Make a backend repo
   a. `rails new YOUR_APP_NAME --api`
   b. `rails generate resource RESOURCE_NAME ATTRIBUTES`
   c. `render json:` & Serialization
2. Make a frontend repo
   a. `touch index.html`, `touch style.css`, `touch main.js`
   b. Boilerplate HTML
   c. Punt on CSS
   d. `document.getElementbyId`, `fetch`, `createElement`, `append`, ...
3. ???
4. Profit!

## Serialization

- Serialization allows us to control and specify the shape of the data (in this case json) that we receive from our backend
- Add `active_model_serializers` to Gemfile
- Create a serializer `rails g serializer animal`

```ruby
class AnimalSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name, :species
  # belongs_to :species

  def species
    object.species.name
  end
end
```

## Takeaways

- [x] JSON is a light-weight, standardized data structure similar to a Ruby hash
- [x] Rails can be configured as a RESTful API
- [x] CORS is a means of preventing unauthorized requests from other websites
- [x] Keep your front and back ends separate
